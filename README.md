Particular Presence Technologies Technical Evaluation February 4-8, 2020

Krace Gennedy has an employee workforce of 500 (200 in Montego Bay, 300 in Kingston)
manufacturing workers. The boss man has realized that when it rains productivity is generally low
for the following reasons:
• People don't show up for work
• People get to work late
The IT guys work on the street so they tend to get stuck a lot on the road, thus halting other
things.
There needs to be a database with all the workers and it should contain at a minimum name, address1, city, country, telephoneNo, role, email, address location.
The boss has the following criteria:
• If it’s going to be a rainy day he sends a notification to affected employee (i.e. his city) with a
schedule change - effectively, they're only working 4 hours today and not the usual 8 hours
• If it’s sunny then an email is sent to the employees to let them know they're scheduled for 8 hours
tomorrow
• If it's going to rain any day, then the IT people should get an email from the boss explaining that
they shouldn't hit the streets
The boss enjoys DVM weather forecast with Martia-May Levans in the evenings but sometimes he
doesn't catch it and is unable to send the notifications that are required.
The boss has asked you to build an application with a basic user interface that will check and display the weather forecast for the next 5 days and automate the sending of emails out to staff.
You can pull forecast data from an external source (hint: API) such as http://openweathermap.org/API. Use your discretion.
